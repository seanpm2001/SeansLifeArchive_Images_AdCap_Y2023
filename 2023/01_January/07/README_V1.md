# Notice - Didn't play

I skipped my AdCap session today to save time, as I didn't feel like like playing this week. I might play again next week. It isn't that likely though.

I plan to return eventually to finish some parts of the game, then I will permanently wrap up. I am currently considering switching the day of gameplay to Monday.

## 2022, Saturday, March 5th

This week, I strongly considered swapping my AdCom session for an AdCap session, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but decided against it. Even then, I considered doubling up the sessions, but since my AdCom session went on for far too long, I didn't have the time for it. Hope for returning to this game definitely isn't dead.

## 2022, Saturday, June 11th

Due to a massive resource waste in AdVenture Communist today, I considered playing AdCap to fill in the time. I ended up playing much longer than expected, and was unable to get to AdCap today. - 2022, Saturday, June 4th to 2022, Saturday, June 11th

Considerations are still being made to return, but that didn't happen today. - 2022, Saturday, June 18th to 2022, Saturday, December 10th

## 2022, Saturday, December 17th

I had a difficult time gaining focus and waking up today, and considered playing AdCap and AdCom. I didn't, as I didn't have the time to do so. Hope is not completely dead for my return. - 2022, Saturday, December 17th

## Past issues

<details><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

### HyperHippo ad controversy (2022 March 26th - 2022 July 16th)

The parent company for AdVenture Communist and AdVenture Capitalist (and also AdVenture Ages, and Vacation Tycoon (newly released) which I don't play) is having an ongoing controversy regarding suppressing community criticism regarding increasing montization of their games. It currently looks like the company is going to run itself out of business over greed, so my gameplay of the 2 games is now on life support. I hope to continue on for as long as I can, but be prepared that the cord may be cut any day now. Unfortunately, these are online only games that don't have offline play support, so when HyperHippo dies, I can no longer play.

It is looking like they are going to survive this controversy, but I can't be sure. - 2022 March 26th to 2022 July 16th.
